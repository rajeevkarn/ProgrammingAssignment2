## Put comments here that give an overall description of what your

## makeCacheMatrix() fucntion makes a mtrix cacheable
## cacheSolve() function retrives the inverse of a matrix from chache and if not found in chache then
## it calculates the inverse and chaches it


## Write a short comment describing this function
## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse
makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}



## Write a short comment describing this function
##  This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by 
## makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated 
## (and the matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve should retrieve 
## the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
